index.js ->Entry Point
index.html has id="root" selector where react components is loaded when application starts on browser

React DOM is library which provide render () to load Initial React component  ->APP component which is loaded inside html id="root" selector inside index.html

React Hooks Helps to provide all those features to function base components which are provided by class based compoents like state 
handling,JS classes,Lifecycle Methods

ClassBased Component ->Function Based Component
Js Classes ->JS Functions
JSX using render method->JSX using only return statement
State,props -> Hooks (useState)
Lifecycle Methods => Hooks (useEffect)


object is key-value pair
state ->keyword is provided by react

State is a piece of data(js object) which we need to save which will change or update in future
props is sort of data which we can use to communicate between components(parents ->child)
child->parent communication of data is done using callback method
to update state object in react direct updation is not possible rather setState is used to set state object
App compoennt is parent of all compoennts
Direct child->child communication is not possible,First child will send data to parent and parent will transfer that data to another child Component
useState Hook allow us to use state inside our functional based component in order to update or change data object
We cant have complex object to maintain state using useState hook
We cant have single setter function in useState rather to have separate setter functiom for each data


React components are reusable eg:navigation menu :-once made are usable at each page
components -> visual elements we see on screen eg: navbar,header,search



Browser doesnt understand JSX so it need to transpile to JS using babel for
browser understanding  by manually configuring babel incase we are not using 
create-react-app boiler plate which provide entire automated configuration of react
application as it also have babel,webpack along in its package for components transpilation
CRA also provides us feature of bundling all js and css file into single file when we have prod build for prod environment of our application



React.Component provides various features like states,props,lifecycle methods
